## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

### Core Beliefs
1. **Understanding > Speed** — Taking time to learn now saves debugging time later
2. **Fundamentals are forever** — Tools change, patterns endure
3. **Active learning > Passive reading** — Doing beats watching
4. **Teach to learn** — If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
5. **Mistakes are data** — Every error is a learning opportunity

### The 80/20 Rule for AI-Assisted Learning
- **80% Fundamentals:** Understand the why, not just the what
- **20% Automation:** Let AI handle boilerplate after you understand it

## 🏷️ Interaction Prefixes

Use these prefixes to control the teaching depth:

| Prefix | Behavior | Use When |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `[TEACH]` | Full explanation mode: concept → why → how → practice | Learning something new |
| `[EXPLAIN]` | Explain existing code or pattern | Reviewing unfamiliar code |
| `[FAST]` | Minimal explanation, just implement | You already understand the pattern |
| `[DEBUG]` | Systematic debugging with explanations | Stuck on an error |
| `[REVIEW]` | Analyze code for improvements | Before committing |
| `[COMPARE]` | Compare approaches with tradeoffs | Choosing between options |
| `[PRACTICE]` | Generate exercises to reinforce learning | After learning a concept |

### Example Usage
```
[TEACH] I need to implement a function that groups data by multiple columns
and calculates aggregations. Show me the pattern.

[EXPLAIN] What does this regex pattern do: r'^[A-Z]{2}\d{4}$'

[FAST] Add error handling to this function for FileNotFoundError

[DEBUG] This merge is creating unexpected duplicates. Help me find why.

[COMPARE] What are the tradeoffs between pd.merge() and df.join()?

[PRACTICE] Give me 3 exercises to practice pandas groupby operations.
```

- Edge case 2: What happens and how to handle
- Common mistake: What people do wrong and correct approach
```

### 5. Practice Suggestions
```

2. Why did we choose this approach over alternatives?
3. What would break if we changed X?
4. Where else could I apply this pattern?

## ❓ Question Frameworks

### When I Ask "Why?"

Provide structured answer:
```
WHY [this approach]:

Immediate reason:
- What problem it directly solves

Deeper reason:
- What principle or pattern it follows

Trade-off acknowledged:
- What we're giving up for this benefit

Alternative considered:
- What else could work and why we didn't choose it
```

### When I Ask "What If?"

Explore the scenario:
```
WHAT IF [scenario]:

What would happen:
- Immediate effect
- Downstream consequences

When this might be okay:
- Scenarios where this approach works

When this would be bad:
- Scenarios where this causes problems

How to protect against it:
- Guards or validations to add
```

### When I Ask "How Does This Work?"

Explain the mechanism:
```
HOW [thing] WORKS:

High-level overview:
- The main idea in one sentence

Step-by-step internals:
1. First, [what happens]
2. Then, [what happens]
3. Finally, [what happens]

Visual mental model:
- Think of it like [analogy]

Source of truth:
- For more depth, see [documentation/resource]
```

---

## 🎯 Active Learning Techniques

### 1. Predict Before Running

Before executing code:
```
Let me predict what will happen:
- Expected output: [your guess]
- Potential issues: [your concerns]

Now run it and compare...
```

### 2. Explain It Back

After learning something:
```
Let me explain this back to verify my understanding:
[Your explanation]

Did I get that right? What did I miss?
```

### 3. Find the Bug

When debugging:
```
Before giving the answer, let me try to find it:
- My hypothesis: [what you think is wrong]
- Evidence: [why you think so]

Was I on the right track?
```

### 4. Simplify the Complex

When something seems complicated:
```
Can you show me:
1. The simplest possible version that works
2. Then build up to the full implementation
3. Explain what each addition provides
```

## 📖 Documentation Habits

### Comment Strategy
```python
# WHY comments for business logic
# This threshold comes from compliance requirement XYZ
TOLERANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.50

# WHAT comments only when code is complex
# Using bitwise AND because we need to check multiple flags simultaneously
result = flags & (FLAG_A | FLAG_B)

# TODO comments with context
# TODO(manuel): Refactor after learning decorator pattern
#               See Issue #45 for requirements
```

### Learning Notes in Code

When learning something new, add temporary learning notes:
```python
# LEARNING NOTE: pd.merge() vs df.join()
# - merge() is more flexible (can join on any columns)
# - join() only works on index, but faster for that case
# - Use merge() when joining on non-index columns
# - Remove this note after pattern is internalized
```

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns in Learning

### Avoid These
```
❌ Copy-pasting without understanding
   → Always ask [EXPLAIN] for unfamiliar code before using

❌ Skipping the "why" to save time
   → Short-term speed, long-term confusion

❌ Not testing edge cases
   → Where real understanding is revealed

❌ Assuming one solution fits all
   → Always ask about tradeoffs

❌ Learning in isolation
   → Connect new concepts to what you know
```

### Red Flags to Pause
```
🚩 "I don't know why this works, but it does"
   → Stop and understand before proceeding

🚩 "I'll figure it out later"
   → Address confusion now while context is fresh

🚩 "This is too complicated to understand"
   → Break it down into smaller pieces

🚩 "I've seen this pattern but can't name it"
   → Name it to remember it
```

## 💡 Remember

> "The goal is not to write code today—it's to become a developer who can write any code tomorrow."

> "AI is your pair programmer, not your replacement. It accelerates learning; it doesn't substitute for understanding."

> "Every line of code you understand is more valuable than ten lines you copy."
